04042 | Eyes
04217 | This scroll to Nipa standing up waits a few frames before starting, and is much faster.

04424 | This episode : Eyes
04558 | Krupinski and Nipa's pupils are now shaded better.
04654 | Hikari's uniform tie has been filled in blue in the right places.

05900 | Slighty repositioning of both Nipa and Naoe's breath condensation.
06236 | More realignment
06300 | The shot is slightly zoomed out on the blu-ray version
06540 | Alongside the eyeshines, Rall's collar is shaded darker behind her neck.
06551 | Continuing the trend of removing bits of Nipa's face, the shadow below her mouth has been deleted.
06668 | Naoe is higher up and to the right in this shot, keeping the focus on her speaking rather than on Hikari's busom.
06953 | Eyebeams. Also for a few frames of the TV version, a lock of Hikari's hair goes transparent below her eyelash.
07123 | A patch of her hair behind Hikari's neck has been fixed.
07485 | Her eyes have been shaded better, and there's a patch of blush on her cheek that is blended in with the shading.

09049 | Hikari's hair shadow on her face no longer ends abruptly upon meeting the light shading.
09186 | Sadako is now eating right handed, which is good because her left handed spoon grip looks ridiculous.
09388 | Alongside changing her handedness, they fixed her neck and delayed her eyes opening by a few frames.
09568 | Sadako's right arm is now visible as per the previous changes, and they completely redrew Georgette for some reason.

10715 | Rossman's sleeve is coloured in correctly, and Rall has been repositioned to be more visible.
11322 | The chairs have been redrawn and their shadows removed. Sadako now puts her arm down partway through the pan rather than just leaving it up.
12196 | Eyes!
12245 | Part of Rall's collar was mistakenly coloured the same as her shirt, this has been corrected.
12768 | For this sequence of Sadako cooking, she's been completely redrawn;
12769 | Hahahahahahahahahaha
13358 | Hikari has been redrawn slightly. Side note, since her blush marks and general skin tone is the same, I'm starting to suspect they use a digital texture or something to quickly fill in faces.
13708 | Hikari and Nipa have both been redrawn
13901 | The background to Nao doing some crossfit has been moved slightly.

15420 | Different lighting, smaller propellors.
15484 | Rossman's shirt colar has been fixed.
15700 | Different lighting and slightly different particles.
15715 | The anatomy is still a bit messed up, but they fixed some obvious CG hallmarks like the weird hair shines and too-3D looking shading.
15822 | Throughout this (really cool IMO) tracking shot, the background is positioned slightly differently and the water is lighter.
15909 | Hikari is now at least 50% less blurry CG
16116 | Nose!
16198 | CG touchup, completely different sky.
16335 | Redrawn heads, faces and hands.
16883 | The red light is back! Also Sasha now has a chin and the underside of Hikari's flappy collar is the correct colour.
17064 | Rossman's face has been adjusted, has a less pointy chin.
17255 | The timing on Nao's mouth is different.
18243 | Alongside the eye shines, Hikari's hair shine is now missing a patch. Sasha's left iris has a different lower outline.
18376 | Rall's shirt is now the correct colour, but more interestingly than that, the shine on her hair lacked the usual yellow tint in the TV version.
18590 | The usual Eye stuff, plus Rall's mouth has been lengthened a tad. The stripe on her uniform jacket is now green rather than black.
18807 | The highlight on Sasha's tights are more diffuse in these two shots.
18947 | 
19283 | The lighting is darker and even, and more importantly, Nao is now flying the correct striker unit! Probably a stock footage mixup, the strikers are similar looking and both based on variants of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawanishi_N1K>the Shiden fighter plane.</a>
19458 | The red glowies are still present, the underlighting provided by the magic circles is slightly dimmer, and Nao's face has been slightly redrawn with a rounder jawline.
19954 | The lighting on Nipa and Nao's weapons is lighter, Sasha's face has been redrawn, and Hikari is floating lower and further away from the group.
20124 | The image is sharper and the characters are less obviously CG, check Nao's face plaster for a good example.
20136 | Different movements, and you can actually make out the ground amongst the clouds.
20224 | Patchier clouds, plus redder beams.
20363 | Clouds.
20389 | Hikari's eyes have more complete outlines, and her brow was missing a shadow.
20412 | Different positions and clouds.
20530 | The characters have been drawn in, awful CG facial animation is nowhere to be seen.
20720 | Clouds!
20805 | This tense action shot has had it's only muzzle flash removed. Weird. At least she's wearing her magic punch gloves.
20959 | Particles aren't as red or bloomy as they used to be, and the flash has been redrawn blurrier.
20972 | The shading on Nao's face is less sharp and jojo-y.
21048 | Hikari is holder her weapon lower, Nao is recoloured.
21146 | Clouds!
21271 | Brighter flash, slightly different clouds.
21442 | In the TV version, the Neuroi completely breaks apart and is see through after being damaged, in the Blu-ray, only the surface is broken immediately.
21584 | The damaged areas on the Neuroi spread across the hull in the BD version.
21701 | The character replacements are posed slightly differently and there are fewer floaty particles.
21737 | The ejection port on Hikari's weapon isn't filled in anymore, and the weird black splodge over the barrel is removed.

23800 | This shot is framed differently, with Nao positioned closer to the centre. She's also been redrawn with different shading and better looking strikers.
23870 | Hikari has an almost complete redraw to replace her CG counterpart.
24035 | In a neat bit of continuity, this flashback also contains the fixed shadows from earlier.
24100 | Hikari's ear fluffs are brighter and her nose has lost it's shadow.
24260 | Nao is holding her weapon at a different angle and Hikari has thicker outlines in a few places. Most noticeable on her hands and the detail lines on her striker.
24287 | The lower half of Nao's shirt has been removed, probably because it was static and removing it would be less work than animating it. Also, they fixed her occasionally vanishing right ear.
24860 | She's been repositined slightly and her weapons shoulder strap goes over the shoulder now, not into it.
24970 | Hikari has been moved up slightly to make it look less like she's about to cause a collision.
25000 | 
25113 | Nose shadow!
25400 | The branch intersecting Nipa's side has been removed and her mouth animation is delayed by a few frames.

25792 | Ears and nose!

25930 | And Nao's weapon strap and vents have been drawn in. Her mouth is a fraction closer to the middle of her face, and all the characters have upgraded eye beams.

26624 | Brighter flash and much cleaner image quality.
26711 | Usual cg character replacement switch. The sparks from her striker are now streaming from the propellor mechanism rather than just forward of it.
26836 | Darker outlines on nearly everything.
26867 | More darker outlines.
26982 | Outlines and retimed shots.
27100 | Nipa's weapon strap : now in brown.
27515 | Different pose, clouds and contrails.
27725 | The lighting falling on Chidori is now evening flavoured and the engraving isn't as bulky.
28170 | Hikari's eyebrows have been fixed, perfecting this already great image.
28270 | Better looking muzzle flash, and Hikari's right propellor is no longer overlapping Nipa's striker.
28355 | The big beam crossing the screen vanishes faster on the blu-ray.
28369 | Everything is now the correct colour and the beams aren't as blurry.
28560 | Complete, and much appreciated, redraw.
28630 | Like before, the damage now spreads before the Neuroi explodes. 
28720 | Hikari now has a red face from exertion, and they both have eye shines.
28830 | Nose shadow!
28914 | Everyone has been replaced with a differently sized duplicate, complete with extra eyeshines.

30326 | Nao's face has been redrawn.
31134 | Rossman's mouth has been retimed.
31354 | Lots of small fixes here, the gap between Hikari's arm and her torso is now see through and her tie was missing a small section, the stripe on her collar is now white, and both of them have slightly different eyes.
