00222 | The hideous motion blur has been removed, and contrails have been added to Hikari's strikers.
00298 | 
00784 | Hikari's face and uniform collar has been redrawn.
01002 | The shaped backgrounds are coloured differently, generally darker than the TV version. 
01030 | 
01063 | Krupinski's face is slightly redrawn.
01079 | As is Georgette's.
01113 | And Shimohara.
01159 | And Rossman.
01180 | But not Rall.
01255 | First up, the Neuroi craft is slightly further away, and the ships are now leaving a wake. The lighting is brighter and softer.
01280 | Hikari's butt is no longer CGI. On a less important note, Hikari herself is no longer CGI.
01311 | The heavy shading used to hide the bad CGI has been removed.
01334 | Kanno is leaning back further, and is much more detailed overall.
01337 | Possibly the most noticeably improved single frame of the entire sequence.
01385 | It seems the CGI Nipa was traced over.
01392 | 
01410 | Krupinski is looking good
01420 |
01441 | Reframed shot to bring the Neuroi craft more central.
01490 | Shimohara is no longer a blurry mess.
a.gif | This bit was redone with bigger and closer explosions, some obscuring the camera at points.
01537 | Georette.
01581 | Brighter muzzle flash from Rossman.
01618 | Hahahahaha.
01630 | Rall.
01694 | Hikari now has propellers and the neuroi is now central in the frame.
01758 | 
b.gif | This explosion is more vivid and has a better looking flash.
01946 | Takami's face has been redrawn.
02005 | She no longer has a lazy left eye.
02156 | And finally, closing shot of the emblem is now inside a hangar and is lit completely differently. Weirdly, some of the damage to the wall around it is almost identical.
