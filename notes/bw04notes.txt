00543 | Caps added to the table.
01014 | Rall's mouth has been redrawn, but only on the shouty frames.
03345 | The plane is further away from the camera than it was before.
03918 | Completely inconsequential, but the tiny band of lighter wood at the  edge of this table has a slightly different texture.
04425 | Jumping Hikari still looks pretty meh despite the redraw and different timing. the camera has been zoomed in a bit.
04941 | Rossman walks to a slightly different spot, and <a href=".\images\extra\dance.gif">Hikari no longer stands there jiggling for a whole second.</a>.
06292 | The spinning propeller disapears for a few frames in the blu-ray version, which better creates the illusion of stuttery movement.
06299 | When it's not dissapearing, the propeller is drawn slightly differently.
06468 | Rossman's eyelashes are now visible above her hair.
06584 | The outlines are overall thicker, mostly visible above the traffic light thing.
06291 | More of the above propeller trickery. Because it looks exactly the same, I'm reusing the same frame to save your page load times and my bandwidth.
07038 | Tiny blob of purple removed, look where the salad bowl meets the plate above it.
07089 | Two more anomalous blobs removed, one between the salad and the grape plate, the other just peeking from behind the plate of ... ham?.
07100 | Redrawn plate in the foreground.
07240 | Nao, Nipa, and the tableware has been redrawn.
07813 | The safety indicator is now pointing towards the firing position. The labels themselves have been moved around a bit to make room for the new position of the switch.
07967 | Rossman's hair is overall shaded a tiny bit darker, with the shine no longer overlapping a shadow.
08083 | Hikari is still CG in this shot, which is a damn shame, but at least the shading is a tiny bit better. 
08184 | At any rate, I'm really glad she's no longer holding the weapon by the ammo drum.
08550 | New shine on Chidori.
08670 | Rossman has been redrawn.
08870 | Hikari is either further back, or slightly smaller.
09625 | Rossman's nice hat settles for a few frames, instead of staying completely static. Once it does settle, it's slightly further to the left.
10292 | Rossman looses an ear for a frame on TV.
10764 | Hikari's ear fluff and collar have been corrected.
11871 | The ill advised crash-zoom on starting this scene has been removed.
11919 | Extra plate added. Normally this would be for continuity reasons, but the contents are different in the wide shot.
12173 | And this over the top zoom has been added, emphasising how awful getting sauce in your eye is.
12232 | Which pulls out further than the original static version, leading to a more balanced shot.
12502 | Another dramatic zoom added to transition into Hikari's dramatic bird encounter.
13060 | Nipa's sweater now has the usual lines on the sleeves, plus Hikari's face has had a minor tweak.
15260 | They didn't alter the sauna scene at all, It's exactly as aired. sorry Anon.</li><li>Hikari climbing the pillar in the distance is much smaller.
16313 | Missing part of stripe on Hikari's uniform.
16314 | And on the very next frame, they've given Hikari very slight eyelashes, while fixing another part of her poor collar.
16490 | Hikari is lower down the pillar here.
16789 | The patch on Nipa's sleeve is back, and Hikari's pointy bit of hair is recoloured to the usual brown.
16808 | Hikari's eyes, nose and collar have been fixed while she's falling backwards.
17870 | Rossman's eyes have been redrawn.
20095 | Hikari's clothes, tail and hair are flapping around in the wind differently in the next few shots.
20176 | 
20268 | 
20640 | Everyone has been redrawn.
20918 | Like before, the wind is blowing in a different direction, I guess.
21198 | Hikari now has a shadow.
22810 | The stripes on Rall's shoulders are coloured in.
23504 | CG-ish shading has been removed, but the animation remains the same.
23750 | Nipa and Nao have been redrawn.
24000 | Different rain effect, and a patch on the back of Hikari's collar is now coloured white.
24330 | Nao is nao wearing her glove
24444 | Same as above, but her arm is also better proportioned.
24513 | Hikari looks less bored with the whole ordeal.
24530 | 
24630 | Better proportions and anatomy.
24730 | Completely new animation.
25060 | Nao's backside and strikers are lit better.
25176 | Nao flies past the camera faster, under brighter lighting.
25190 | Hikari has been redrawn, brighter lighting, too.
25331 | Rossman looks better. Gonna Divert for a second to say this scene just bugs me, Hikari is questionably useful on the battlefield ontop of being completely exhausted from the week climbing this pillar, and Rossman just lets her fly? It serves the dramatic purpose of the episode, but is a really stupid decision. 
25592 | Completely redrawn shot with more detail and a better angle.
25609 | Flatter shading on Hikari's hair and tail.
25700 | Brighter lighting to match the other shots.
25778 | Darker and sharper sky, alongside the usual stuff.
25984 | Brighter lighting on Nipa's weapon, Nao's scarf is flappier, and the propellers are brighter.
26122 | Krupinski is leaning over further, and her strikers are shaded differently.
26130 | Brighter 'n sharper flash.
26210 | Patchier clouds.
26333 | Nipa's nose has been fixed and she has additional shadows.
26400 | Less cloud cover like before, and Nao is shaded differently.
26460 | Different background clouds.
26515 | Nao has been completely redrawn.
26660 | Less clouds, and Nipa is shaded better. Shame they didn't redo her face a bit.
26680 | Hikari and Rossman have redrawn heads, and the shading is slightly brighter.
26772 | Nao's arm patch is the correct colour, her shirt has an aditional shadow from her scarf and her eyes have an extra shine.
26870 | New clouds with a higher horizon line. What are the Brave Witches Neuroi supposed to resemble, anyway?
26903 | Hikari's animation is the same, but delayed slightly.
27030 | Nao does a sensible turn, rather than the weird upside down flip she did in the TV version.
27114 | Different framing here.
27130 | The lighting changes here no longer suggest that Rossman glows slightly.
27180 | Ground changed to reflect them flying over land, not sea.
27272 | Outlines!
27349 | The camera is further away from Hikari, the ground is now visible and the laser starts and ends earlier.
27457 | Usual flying redraws. Will accept suggestions on new ways of phrasing this.
27487 | Hikari's hair and collar animation is exactly the same, just running a few frames ahead.
27677 | Ground and outlines.
27715 | Various minor fixes on Nao, the Fuso patch on her arm is darker, the tip of scarf is green in the right places and her left eye has been redrawn.
27870 | Rossman, again, is less glowy. Wonder why this happened. Also, a stray lock of hair behind her left ear has been removed.
27920 | Usual lines and clouds stuff.
27990 | Much brighter flash replacing the epilepsy-safe TV version.
28020 | This shot has a bit of motion blur going on, and Hikari's hair and propellers have different shading.
28128 | In the TV version, the muzzle flash just stays there for a whole 2 seconds, the blu-ray makes this look better by making it flicker.
28230 | Darker clouds surrounding the Neuroi as seen by Hikari's plot vision.
28294 | More focussed flash, slightly darker shading on Hikari's body.
28440 | Rossman's glow has been removed, and her right eyelash has been redrawn.
28534 | Sasha's weapon has the vents shaded black and a strap/stand(?) removed.
28722 | Damage spread added.
28987 | Characters have been replaced, and the shot is reframed slightly.
29145 | Less glowing Rossman, more clouds. Also in the blu-ray version, her mouth is animated, the TV version it seemed to imply an inner monologue rather than actual dialogue.
29691 | The wonky lamp and missing telephone dial have been fixed. For some reason, the phones cord gets cut off a bit too short in the blu-ray version.
30020 | Rall's eyes have been shaded darker to better fit the lighting.
30496 | This shot of Hikari is lit warmer. Comfy!
30620 | More Ralleye.
