sw203|Strike Witches 2 #03 - That Which We Can Do
In this episode they had the opportunity to use brooms during the battle and it would have been a <i>fantastic</i> chance to do something different, they didn't and that makes me sad. <br/>A very quality episode on TV. Most of the blu-ray fixes are fixed technically, with better continuity and effects, but the overall quality is actually worse in many shots. What the hell happened?

00660|The Strike Witches emblem on the side of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMC_CCKW_2%C2%BD-ton_6x6_truck">this truck</a> has been swapped with the outline version you never see. Looks good.
01247|This closeup of Junko's face has fixed chin and nose shadows.
02100|Another shot of the replaced logo.
02155|They removed shines from the van windows.
02275|On the TV version, Miyafuji blinks and then goes cross-eyed.
03363|Again, Miyafuji's poor face has been rearranged.
03450|Lynette's, Miyafuji's and Perinne's animations here are completely redrawn. The replacement animation is drawn with a thicker line that doesn't look nearly as sharp, adding the blush marks and tweaking a few lines would have made more sense than completely redoing everything.
03462|
03489|
03552|
03584|
03676|
04148|Redrawn mid-air collision.
04164|
04213|Perrine's dramatic nose shadow is blended correctly.
04297|Redrawn collapsed background witches people, this one is a genuine improvement.
04964|Perrine is almost completely redrawn, but in such a way that it looks nearly identical.
05404|The metal basin landing now kicks up dust and the shot has some blur added.
05450|Perrine is once again completely redrawn.
05650|Anna is positioned higher and has redrawn eyes.
06785|Redrawn and reframed shot.
06987|
07530|The witches readying to fly has been redrawn with more vacant facial expressions and less detailed shading.
07800|
08125|Thicker Lynette in the redraw.
08473|This broom tomfoolery has been redrawn completely and moved slightly.
08484|
08511|
08528|
08533|
09125|Perrine looks flustered.
09240|Stronger blush added, oh dear.
09478|The broom is bobbing up and down slower, and they fixed an animation error where Anna's hand clips into the broom.
09500|On TV, Anna lowers her hand after raising it.
09576|Redrawn Perinne with a larger coat.
09650|Her eyes and mouth have been redrawn, and the blob of sweat above her left eyebrow is thicker.
09672|Perrine's head.
09947|Her coat has more detailed shading, and her tights and broom are shinier.
09988|Everything but the background has been redrawn.
10075|
11671|Everyone here has been redrawn. Weirdly, Anna looks far better on TV, with higher quality linework. This is around the point in the episode where I started to double check I hadn't mixed up my framedumps.
12039|<abbr title="Especially Lynette, hah">Everyone here</abbr> looks flatter.
12123|Anna looks happier.
12341|Precious smile.
12481|Miyafuji <strong>really</strong> needed this redraw.
12703|Anna bobs up and down at a different rate while talking.
12872|Perrine having a <abbr title= "Majors crotch has been here - t.Perrine">private moment</abbr> has been redrawn without the layering issue with her cheek.
13379|Redrawn snuggle.

15124|<hr><img src="./images/eyecatch/sw02/sw0203catch.png" width="100%" /><hr></li><li>Censor sunbeams removed from this close-up of Yoshika trying to sit comfortably.
15377|Perrine her is redrawn at a different angle.
16569|Yoshika floats away from the ground slower, but otherwise looks the same.
16726|Everyone has been redrawn, and the sky is <abbr title="This episode is such a quality-fest, I almost miss cloudposting">slightly repositioned</abbr>.
16890|This shot has the witches much closer to the camera before eventually flying away. Unfortunately they're drawn in background-character quality.
17145|The CG standins have been replaced. Yoshika's face looks faintly sinister on the Blu-ray.
17440|At least Perrine is enjoying herself now.
18840|Throughout the entire bath scene, censor towels have been removed and the environment is steamier.<p/>The light beam censor added in place of the towel does a good job of hiding the inside of Perrine's legs, showing how raw and painful they look. Good job.
18907|<a href="./images/extra/1331793153675.jpg">Presented without comment.</a>
19340|One type of censor traded for another.
19383|But not here.

21588|Lynette has a tiny shadow added to her face for the blu-ray.
22670|The map is now in a different scale.
23936|The Neuroi-of-the-week is redesigned a little larger and boxier. The usual hexagon texture and permabright red highlights are missing from the TV version. In most of the shot it appears in, the FOV here is generally tighter, giving it a more 3D look.
23995|
24238|The usual suspects have been redrawn again.
24637|Anna is wrinklier and frownier.
24849|Neuroi showing more detail.
25122|
25398|Blurrier shot of a Perrine with redrawn strikers.
25436|Brighter shot of the Neuroi showing more damage and detail.
25452|Brightness.
25554|Closeup of the fixed Neuroi texturework.
25630|Perrine's hair is flappier and Lynette in the background ends up looking a little puzzled.
25715|New hair and collar flapping animation of Miyafuji.
25784|Lynette has been sharpened up. Still looks a bit concerned.
25906|Another Miyafuji.
26045|Neuroi replacement.
26055|Zoomed and reanimated shot of the characters beam-dodging.
26163|Good example of how much bulkier the Neuroi redesign is.
26236|
26440|Brighter shot of Miyafuji firing at the Neuroi.
26530|Everyone has been redrawn smaller with a flatter perspective.
26750|Reframed shot of the Neuroi hull regenerating.
26856|Lynette's hair, coat and tail are flappier.
26918|Did they run through their panty-shot broadcast allocation?
27005|

27413|The Neuroi is much closer to the camera now.
27635|In some shots, but not all, the core is still exposed.
27721|Brighter shot of Perrine
27790|And another, of the core.
27898|The witches are further away from the camera and a big red damage flash has been added to the Neuroi.
28632|Everyone's faces have been redrawn, and a Perrine and Yoshika have some extra linework and shading fixes.
29281|<abbr title="voice casting joke!">Saori Seto doing her best Sakamoto impression</abbr> has been redrawn, along with Minna doing Minna things. The phone, stack of books and the paper Mio is writing in has been moved to fit the new character art.
29700|Reppumaru is looking a bit bulkier here.
29900|zzz
