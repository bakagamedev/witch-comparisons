sw210|Strike Witches 2 #10 - 500 Overs
This episode has a few firsts for me, I did all the spotting on a fancy new IPS monitor that makes it easier to see things in theory, and it was partly written on my shiny new <a href="https://github.com/bakagamedev/Comparitron3000">Comparitron 3000</a> software that i'll probably put the finishing touches on sometime soon.
00682|These splashes are blurrier. Wow!
00990|The is greyer to fit the lighting;
01089|Reppumaru and the glowy border around it is a wee bit smaller;
02493|Minna in the foreground has some subtle linework and shading improvements;
06141|The shot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Ju_52">the plane</a> approaching the base has the camera aimed lower;
06327|The zoom towards the ground is slower, giving Marseille a reasonable amount of distance to slow down. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans-Joachim_Marseille#Death">Unlike her counterpart</a>.
06355|During the DRAMATIC DESCENT, the lighting is brighter and shinier;
06384|
07239|For the singlest of single frames, the patch of white on Marseille's left coat tail went yellow on TV.
08156|The shading on the plane is different, overall darker;
10199|The zoom out from the blackboard is faster and Sakamoto's animation is ahead by a few frames.
12334|This receives the brighter 'n sharper treatment;
13007|Every couple of frames, Marseille's mouth is open a teeny bit less <abbr title="Not to be confused with 'ovular'.">ovalular</abbr>.
13040|Towards the end of the shot, her eyes are a slightly lighter shade of blue.
13687|The background pillars are zoomed in slightly and moved. I'm not sure what was going on with Sakamoto, but it looks painful.
14444|This very brief shot of Erica turning around has some different clouds.
14682|Marseille's open mouth is changed to white teeth;
17747|<hr><img src="./images/eyecatch/sw02/sw0210catch.png"/><hr/>They toned the brightness down here;
18185|Conversely, this outdoors scene is marginally brighter!
18284|
18998|This exciting camera move is very different. It starts in the same spot, but!
19013|The TV version pulls ahead for a split second;
19033|Before slowing down
19046|Allowing the blu-ray to take the lead!
19059|But TV speeds up again towards the end. Exciting stuff.
19216|The table and the cloth upon it is repositioned and Marseille's fingers are now around the outside of her bowl. More importantly, Erica's right arm is now motionless, so we can no longer witness <a href="./images/extra/sw210cheekjab.gif">her jabbing herself in the cheek while eating</a>. 
20682|Oh look, nipples;
20905|Besides the obvious, they added a dot of shine to Marseille's right cheek;
21059|This incredibly fast tilt shot was virtually uncensored to begin with, but the heavy motion blur makes the details difficult to see. For the blu-ray version, they removed the blur but added a moonbeam censor over her crotch. Besides that, most of the steam is removed, and the image is much sharper.
21063|
21159|Marseille's left eyebrow and left collarbone are altered, and the dreaded cheekshine returns;
21267|The towels are no more;
21299|This convienient table and basket are added at crotch height. I don't believe it appears in any other shots;
21379|Luchinini's face has a thinner eye outline and Charlotte's neck is fixed.
21492|Everything is zoomed out slightly;
21557|Luchini keeping things classy;
21667|This shot presented without comment;
21910|The faces here are slightly altered;
21978|The shadow falling across Lynette's face isn't a straight diagonal line anymore, and Miyafuji's eyes, mouth and eyebrows are brand new. In the foreground, Marseille's right arm is repositioned slightly.
22338|This shot of Trude just hanging casually around pans right to left on the blu-ray instead of going left to right really slowly;
26601|Side note, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpeggio_of_Blue_Steel">Arpeggio of blue steel</a> goes 8 years and 13 volumes without even mentioning the pressurised aircraft hangar the i-400 class is designed around, Strike Witches uses it on the first appearance of the submarine, objectively making this the better series. <img src="./images/extra/sw210-bd-25845.jpg"/></li><li>This sequence of quick action shots is brighter and sharper in all the usual ways. Enjoy;

26699|
26872|The glowy red bits on these Neuroi nicknacks are redder;
27672|Erica and Marseille don't move at all on TV;
29267|This shot of Marseille and Erica spinning around is brighter. Instead of a dignified frame, I've picked the dumbest looking tween I could find;
29291|The opposing shot Erica gets the same treatment, but sadly all of her frames look half decent at worst.
29754|The clouds are different and Erica's Striker propellers are glowing;
29866|Blam! Blam! Blam!
29994|The large contrail thingy is now blue.
31201|There's a very tiny speck of white highlight added to Trude's right cheek.
31514|Zooming in, there are some more slight changes to Trude's eyes and eyebrows.
31624|The background no longer resembles a featureless <abbr title="I've only played the first one lol">Virtua Fighter stage background</abbr>;
31664|This carries onto the next shot, with the runway stretching off into the distance;
31834|Just like trude a few moments ago, there's a tiny cheek highlight added to Marseille's face;
31874|This Humikane art card is presented facing the other way;
32247|Throughout the takeoff sequence, the plane is consistently slightly further away from the camera, and the runway actually exists.
32498|Finishing up, the last shot of the episode now starts with a dramatic crash-zoom.
