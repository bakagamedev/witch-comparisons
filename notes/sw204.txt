sw204|Strike Witches #02 - Hard, Fast, Amazing!

02020|<abbr title="I can't actually spell Lucchini without looking it up so I've set my spellchecker to fix all my usual misspellings of her name">Lucchini</abbr> relaxing atop a beam is now blushing in the heat.
05285|I actually spat my drink out on seeing this one. Poor Erica. Alongside the obvious, Erica has a slightly redrawn eye and Trude has an extra small shadow on her uniform.
05712|Erica's chest has been altered again, but this time it's just some shadow work. Everyone's faces have been tweaked in small ways around the eyes.
05972|Erica's boob shadows went weird for a moment on TV.
06037|Speaking of boob shadows, here's a redrawn Shirley;
06708|Shirley's eyes have been redrawn looking a little further across the frame.
06741|Lucchini's tail no longer becomes detached for a moment while flapping around.
07161|The striker stand was pointing in the wrong direction on TV, and Shirley misplaced her shoes.
07365|All the non-background elements here have been moved down and the foreground shading is much darker.
07592|A patch on the stand is no longer painted yellow, and the railing is now drawn correctly.
07693|Everyone in the midground has been completely redrawn and the stand has a shiny fresh coat of paint.
07961|Trude keeps her mouth closed on BD while powering up the jet striker.
08184|The stand has been recoloured with more dramatic shadowing, and Shirley's eye shinies are slightly larger.  
08216|Brighter lighting on this shot of Trude.
08358|Miyafuji has a minor redraw.
08538|The stands have been recoloured.
08587|And again.
08647|And again.
08713|And again. But for a nice change, Lucchini's eyes are shinier.
10517|Shirley's <a href="http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Browning_Automatic_Rifle">BAR</a> is brighter, the shading on her striker is slightly darker and dirtier, and once again, a stand has been recoloured.
11100|Another yellow thing is now black again.
11279|The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BK_5_cannon">ENORMOUS</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MK_108_cannon">GUNS</a> that Trude is holding here are shinier. Please take a moment to admire my attempt at getting this these two frames to line up.
11200|
13017|Miyafuji's eyes are looking more concerned and less like she'd rather be somewhere else.
13645|NSFW Lucchini incoming. 
13669|Miyafuji also has a nipple visible if you look really closely at the splash, and her left thumb is no longer in shadow.
14115|Lucchini's little finger is now layered on the inside of the barrel, but still cutoff like it would be normally, which looks awkward.
14204|More NSFW Lucchini.
14278|
14313|Miyafuji's little finger is also on the inside of the barrel, and Lucchini of all people has a boob highlight.
14372|One more;
14985|Shirley's striker <abbr title="I know they're not really propellers, but I have no idea what to call them otherwise. The wikia suggests 'Aether discharger apparatus'">propellers</abbr> aren't quite as bright as before.
15013|The blu-ray has some extra screen shake and blur.
15346|The jet striker has an extra bright white glow surrounding it. 
15481|This shot has a redrawn deep blue sky with plenty of motion blur ontop.
17940|The jet strikers sitting in the hangar have shinier shading that help bring the highlights out.

19513|This extreme closeup of Trude is no longer obscured by sunbeams.
20138|IT KEEPS HAPPENING.
20641|More Trude, less noodle arm.
21860|Less detailed radar. While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identification_friend_or_foe">IFF did exist</a> in the 1940's, digital readouts certainly did not.
21875|
21940|Reppumaru was missing from Mio's back in this shot.
22600|Here's a bunch of brighter combat shots.
22647|
22682|
22968|
23103|The Neuroi's engine glow has been redrawn more subdued.
23252|Shirleys butt has been redrawn.
23404|And a few more brighter shots;
23429|
23510|
23578|
23809|More of the magic future Radar.
24000|
24390|<abbr title="The juxtaposition of SERIOUS DRAMA and MAGIC BUNNY EARS always makes me chuckle. What a show.">Trude has some edge glow from the sheer white background</abbr> and her eyes are looking less spooky.
24600|TRUDE SMASH.
25331|This particularly flattering shot of Trude being a rebel now has (some) shading.
25440|Shirley face has been fixed so it's roughly the shape of a face, and she's sweating slightly.
25684|Brightness!
25852|A bluer background is behind the Neuroi exploding.
26600|This sequence is marginally brighter and sharper.
26710|
26900|
27159|Shirley zooms closer to the camera faster.
27415|And she's brighter, too.
27693|Charlotte Yeager doing Chuck Yeager things has been redrawn with her arms sticking forward.
27785|Miyafuji is repositioned and redrawn.
28592|Loads of shadow changes here around the hands, and Shirley's face is definitely looking better.
29000|They forgot to draw in Sanya's flappy coat tail things.
29787|Treasure this frame of Miyafuji and Lynette pushing some food around, it's one of the few things in this episode that was completely redrawn.
30280|Lynette's face is looking a little more focussed.
31000|And finally, Eila and Sanya looking onwards at bizarro Erica have been redrawn.
