sw201|Strike Witches 2 #01
Someone on /r/StrikeWitches asked me to do this. The TV version is fairly low quality, but for the moment this is what I'm stuck with. If you have a higher quality copy kicking around, send it in!
00282 | More ash floating around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mark%27s_Campanile">bell tower</a> in the grim opening montage.
01382 | The propellors on Junko's striker unit and the planes behind here are layered correctly. Her face has some minor changes, with larger pupils and lighter hair shadowing on her forehead.
02022 | Opaque propellers. The producers STILL can't make their minds up on this one.
02100 | The other 504th witches move closer to the camera and aren't as blurry.
02581 | The lower portion of Junko's pupil is darker and the clump of hair above her ear is lighter.
03990 | <hr/>The opening titles for Strike Witches 2 are almost entirely untouched, with most of the differences being brightness. This sequence of shots of a battle in the opening sequence are brighter.
04010 | 
04040 | 
04044 | This shot of Lucchini and Shirley is slightly moved and out of focus.
04096 | Brighter shot of Sanya firing her Fliegerhammer.
04190 | The Neuroi damage shard thingies have a glowy border.
04220 | This shot of the Yamato is zoomed out further. It doesn't look like it left a wake on the TV version.
04227 | Completely redrawn flash and smoke, much brighter. 
04832 | Not a comparison, but I've always wondered why they only leave one contrail behind. <img src="./images/extra/bd-04722.jpg" width="100%"/></li><li> The final spinning shot features new shadows underneath the cast.
05364 | <hr/>Perinne's strikers are painted correctly.
05716 | Brighter shot of Eila and Sanya.
05773 | Sanya's Fliergerhammer <abbr title="Innuendo">now has 9 holes to shoot from</abbr>, and her collar is shaded darker. Eila's weapon had a big block covering the trigger area.
05777 | More tweaks, Eila's sleeve covers her wrist, and Sanya's strikers have been spruced up.
05801 | Eila's white undershirt/jacket thing follows the same shadows as the rest of her clothing.
05920 | Strike Witches 2 : The brightening.
05961 |
06164 | Zoomed in cloud background, and bluer and bloomier damage sparkles.
06189 | More blue sparkles.
06237 | Trude's mouth has been redrawn, and the camera is pulled out.
06910 | Miyafuji is far blushier in the Blu-ray. Her eyes are redrawn to make it look like she's looking downwards.
07240 | Miyafuji's butt and the certificate thingy she's holding are shinier.
07504 | Hrngg. Mouth redrawn and blush added.
07569 | More blush! The bushes in the background are covered in cherry blossom leaves, like in the other shots.
07830 | <abbr title="Good word">Buttshine!</abbr>
08060 | The road has been cleaned up a bit.
10381 | Mama Bear has a shinier coat.
10400 | In this closeup, Mama Bear has been completely repainted with new shading. Good stuff. The camera has been pulled out a little bit.
10832 | 
10871 | 
11221 | I see bearly any difference here. Also shadows.
12328 | Blushies.
12588 | Miyafuji's square ear has been rounded off somewhat, her eyes and eyebrows are different, and a weird squiggle by her ear has been removed.
14048 | Michiko is a tad shorter and has been redrawn with her usual skintone, but I can't honestly say it looks much better.
14464 | Her left (your right) eyebrow isn't cut off strangely at the top. 
16217 | <hr><img src="./images/eyecatch/bw/sw02logo.jpg" width="100%" /><hr></li><li> The grassy bit on the right side has a dusting of cherry blossom leaves, and the background town is shaded differently. Most weirdly, the midground buildings and power lines have been duplicated onto the background layer, with no parallax effect. It's painfully obvious and looks weird, so maybe this was a mistake?
17482 | <video controls loop width="auto" src="./images/sw201/sw201parralax.webm"/> </li><li> Subtle blush, <abbr title="Nothing can hide from me!">almost hidden by the shading, but it's there.</abbr>
17932 | More blush changes, going from a liney pokemon thing to a luminescent red thing. Her eye shinies have a new diffuse border, too.
18065 | 
18180 | <abbr title="We want the Deviantart crowd - AIC">They fattened Miyafuji up a bit in this shot</abbr>, and fixed her collar.
18494 | Best girl's mouth has a different timing in these two shots.
18830 | 
20012 | The indicator lights on this radio equipment has been toned down a bit.
20028 | 
21484 | 
22218 | The lighting over Sakamoto is oranger and moodier.
22492 | The orange lighting carries over into this later shot.
23060 | The background behind Miyafuji is smaller.
24444 | The wake left by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawanishi_H8K">the seaplane</a> was layered infront of it, which has been corrected.
24498 | Something offscreen casting a shadow on the splash left by the plane has been removed.
24600 | In the TV version, the shadows of the dock equipment in the midground is mistakenly infront of the buildings surrounding it. The town itself is shaded darker, and the foreground bushes are slightly out of focus.
27170 | Miyafuji's strikers and swimsuit are now shinier
27621 | Her face has been slimmed down somewhat, and her left ear has been redrawn to fit. At the very top of the frame, the orange of her ears has been coloured in.
33192 | <hr/>Besides the <abbr title="Which I'm not going to touch">staff credit changes</abbr>, the only major change to the ending sequence is long background scroll behind the witches being zoomed out, and redrawn with more ruins and details.
