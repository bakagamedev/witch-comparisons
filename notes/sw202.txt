sw202 | Strike Witches 2 #02
Presenting Series 2's obligatory "main character is on a ship in distress on the second episode" episode.
00001 | Difference on the very first frame, golly. The zoom out from the Neuroi hives starts slightly further out on the BD version.
00128 | Quick flashbacks to last weeks episode, containing the same fixes.
00321 | 
00351 | 
04289 | Sakamoto's chin has been redrawn, and the collary bit of her cloak has been adjusted.
05640 | The shading on the crewman in the background have been tweaked.
08229 | During the beach scene with Sakamoto testing her shield, the shadows have been blurred and lightened in this shot.
08923 | Sakamoto doing the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BladeReflection">Mulan thing</a> with her sword has been redrawn shinier.
09011 | The TV version of this shot ends with a zoom while fading back to the <abbr title="present time">present day</abbr>, while the Blu-ray is static.
09251 | The background has been given some focal blur to draw attention to the foreground, Sakamoto's cloak is darker and Miyafuji's right cuff has had fixed shadows.
09266 | A few frames later, a single-frame dark patch under Miyafuji's shirt has been corrected.
09325 | Sakamoto's Reppumaru has been redrawn with new shadows and highlights. Miyafuji's eyes are less shiny.
09440 | The missing striker stand has been added behind Miyafuji.
09510 | The sky outside the window is a deeper shade of blue, and Sakamoto's face has had some changes. Her eyebrows are longer and her visible eye is shaded darker.
09571 | Her mouth has been moved downwards and a patch of shadow on her hair has been removed.
09651 | Extra shadow added to her left ear.
09780 | Again with the striker stand.
10055 | Miyafuji's eyes are shaded darker and Sakamoto's mouth has been reanimated, alongside the previous tweaks to Reppumaru.
10498 | Strikeerrrss.
10680 | Different shading in this scene, Miyafuji's swimsuit and strikers are shinier, the big green indicator light is brighter, and the metal stand is more metallic looking.
11036 | Shinier strikers.
11068 | This takeoff shot has been reframed.
11213 | Just like this flying shot.
11450 | The sky is tinged with red and blue from Miyafuji blocking Neuroi beams with her shield. As an added bonus, the cockpit is shaded darker.
11547 | The table in the center of the room has been re-textured with a nice wood grain, and the strikers resting ontop of it are looking much less flat.
12308 | In this frame of Lucchini doing cute Lucchini things, her ear has a fixed inner shadow and the patch on her sleeve is slightly different.
12350 | Ear, ear, ear.
12360 | Lucchini's communicator has been added to her ear. Nice catch, director, I'd almost forgotten these things existed. A couple of lines here and there are slightly moved. 
13319 | Big diagonal shadow added to this shot.
13696 | The clouds behind CGI Miyafuji are zoomed out. 
13698 | <abbr title="I know cloudposting is boring, but I really wanted to make this joke">The clouds behind regular Miyafuji are zoomed out.</abbr>
13719 | This looooong tracking shot has been brightened up. 
13766 | 
13802 | 
13892 |
14800 | A portion of the barrel of Miyafuji's weapon goes flesh coloured for a moment on TV. The obvious solution is to erase it completely, whoops. Additionally, her animal ears are missing shadows.
14822 | More ear shadows.
15233 | This tilt shot of Sakamoto is higher up.
15440 | Miyafuji's eyes and nose have been redrawn, she now has a bead of sweat on her cheek, and hey look, another ear shadow fix. 
15456 | She's now gritting her teeth rather than just frowning.
15885 | Minor tweaks to this shot of Sakamoto doing cool Anime things. A stray shine on her hair is removed and she has extra buttlines and crotchshines.
16278 | It's weird they didn't fix Sakamoto just hanging motionless midair.<br/><img title="ACHTUNG! NOT A COMPARISON! ACHTUNG!" src="./images/extra/bd-16211.jpg"/></li><li>This shot of Sakamoto doing cool Anime things has been reframed.
16400 | For some reason, Sakamoto lost her shoes on the TV version. Besides that, the Neuroi damage shards are bloomier.
16700 | An extra line has been added to Sakamoto's neck.
16715 | Miyafuji blinking has been retimed by about half a second, and she opens her mouth rather than starting with it open.
17206 | The pair have been moved marginally downwards. Miyafuji looks concerned.
17320 | Shirley and Lucchini are looking a little sharper, and Shirleys ear has been cut off.
17442 | 
17968 | The sky and Sakamoto's eye has been shaded slightly darker.
18370 | Yoshika's reaction shot has the same contrast changes.

18922 | <hr><img title="doo doo doo doo dodododo doo" src="./images/eyecatch/sw02/sw0202catch.png" width="100%" /><hr></li><li>On the TV version, when Sakamoto lifts her eyepatch, she rips a highlight off her face with it. This is corrected. The other highlight is removed.
18923 | 
18949 | The outline to Sakamoto's plot-vision is slightly different, with the right side blur missing and a weird bar at the top removed.
19101 | Sakamoto has her tail back.
19360 | The other highlight is still MIA.
19480 | Brighter shot of Miyafuji firing her weapon.
19834 | And another.
20400 | When Miyafuji flips around to raise a shield, the background stops scrolling to match her movements on the TV version.
20517 | More ear nonsense fixed.
20624 | 
21018 | This scrolling shot of damage being inflicted is sharper.
21076 | Slightly different framing on the exposed core.
21170 | Miyafuji's strikers, upper shirt and head have been recoloured in places.
21874 | Slight reframe with a touch of motion blur.
21978 | The clouds here scroll at a different speed.
22024 | Shirley flies past slightly slower. Nyoom.
22084 | More cloud changes.
22204 | Miyafuji bobs up and down less agressively on the Blu-ray. 
22619 | More clouds. Clouds are boring. I think I'll stop commenting on the clouds.
22810 | Slightly moved shot of guess who firing her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys_anti-tank_rifle">Anti-tank rifle</a>.
22940 | Thankfully, they realised the pose Lucchini was in would have overbalanced her, so she's now standing upright. Miyafuji looks much happier.
23060 | The black cowling part of Miyafuji's striker was in the wrong place, but unfortunately they fixed it by just covering her leg up more.
23062 | More striker tomfoolery.
23077 | 
23401 | Perrine's weapon is nice and shiny. Swoon.
23690 | Same with Sanya.
24439 | Trude bobs up and down a bit as she's readying hers.
24478 | More bobbing up and down.
24930 | They added some scrolling faint light patches to this shot of Minna flying. It's really faint, but helps get a sense of movement. 
25202 | Sakamoto (finally) getting in her strikers is given a quick dramatic zoom out. 
25472 | Sakamoto's propellers are always activated, rather than popping up a few frames late. 
25521 | This speed bwoosh is blurrier.
25907 | Oh hey, it's this shot from the opening titles.
26172 | The Neuroi is now trailing sparkles.
26260 | Deja-vu. 
26334 | 
26469 |
26511 | 
26743 | 
26791 |
27181 | <abbr title="looking really cute here">Sanya</abbr>'s eyes have been redrawn.
27438 | Framing!
27479 | The Neuroi zooms in as Sakamoto gets closer in the Blu-ray version.
28000 | Trude and Erica are zoomed in and some sparkles are entering the frame.
30688 | <abbr title="If it wasn't for Eila, this could have been done in 2 images.">The Witches have been redrawn for this pan.</abbr>
30931 | 
30999 | 
31037 | Sakamoto's mirth looks less like a grimace.
31435 | Miyafuji is noticeably taller and redrawn, Lynette is merely redrawn.
31620 | Mio's nose has an errant line removed.
31970 | And for our last shot, Perrinne's glasses have the nose rests coloured in.
