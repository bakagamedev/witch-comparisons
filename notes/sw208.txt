sw208|Strike Witches 2 #08 - Please Grant Me Wings
<center><i>I can't think of anything witty to put here, so have a shot of everyones legs, instead.</i></center></p><abbr title="miss u, 2010 /a/">Plothax and battleships</abbr>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj0OtMdI7xo" title="watch nichijou, btw">Because the episode was running a little long for showing on TV, they omitted the opening titles, opting instead for laying the credits over the video. Personally I think this was a good move, as much as I like the song, as it doesn't interrupt the drama for a upbeat chirpy intro. 
00373|The lighting in the scene of Miyafuji sneaking out is colder, looking more like a night scene.
00629|Sakamoto doing cool anime things with her cool anime sword is redrawn and repositioned.
00700|The redraw includes a different pose towards the end of the animation. It looks a little better!
00986|The bubbles are now sparkles.
01127|To make up for the lack of opening titles, they stuck the logo on the titlecard.
01396|Sakamoto has been redrawn with a much less saggy looking boob shadow.
02653|Luchini's finger is no longer painfully dislocated.
02891|Miyafuji looks sharper.
04338|Perrine is lower in the shot and has some minor tweaks, particuarly her eyes and that lone sweat drop. Also her paintball gun has better shading.
04488|
05096|The bobbing motion has been is much stronger, and there are a few minor changes and fixes here and there, particularly the intake of Miyafuji's right striker unit.
06098|The characters have been moved around, and Miyafuji is completely redrawn.
07581|Here's the NSFW moment for the episode;
07697|Alongside the decensoring, Miyafuji has extra eye shinies, a mark on her cheek is now a highlight rather than a shadow, and her mouth is smaller.
09362|Miyafuji's eyes are darker and sadder. Aww :(
09463|It's not quite as obvious, but this continues after she looks up.
10723|The crates and barrel they're sitting on are textured.
10997|Bucket Shadow!
11265|The crates and barrel look better from this angle, too.
11440|And again.
14635|<hr><img width="100%" src="./images/eyecatch/sw02/sw0208catch.png"/><hr/>Minna's left arm is in a different position, and she has a few minor linework changes to her uniform.
17036|Miyafuji's magic glow fades away during this shot on tv, which creates a continuity problem with the next angle, where it's still active.
17679|The shading is darker, particularly on the bright white patches. The dude on the floor in the middle of the shot has sharper facial details.
18403|Most of the shadows on the characters here have been altered and refined, and the checklist the captain is holding has some lines on it.
18870|Just like before, the highlights have been darkened. The awkward looking door that looks pasted over the background layer has been removed.
19530|A stray highlight on Hartmann's chest is removed.
20144|The shredded planes leave more debris behind.
20327|The guy in the background was accidentally placed ontop of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaking_tube">speaking tubes</a> in the foreground.
21013|The gray filter used to reduce contrast has been removed for bright punchy explosiony goodness.
21032|
21385|Miyafuji and Lynette are repositioned, which looks a little more natural, and they seem sharper overall.
21430|
21774|Brighter boom!
22105|The striker stand indicator lights on the far left have swapped positions.
22911|The metal parts of the stands have brand new shiny shading.
24735|Lynette is redrawn softer, and has a section of her chest recoloured.
25451|The background is now out of focus, and Miyafuji has a big blobby tear in her eye.
26029|For a few frames while moving her head, a patch of her hair was missing;
26063|
26131|I should probably mention the big blush mark too, but I was honestly more interested in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_F1M">Plane in the background with the folded wings</a>.
27281|The dude on left here has darker shading to match the rest of the lighting, and <abbr title="Did they mention his name in the episode? I can't remember.">Captain whatshisname</abbr> drops his head slightly earlier.
28383|For a couple of angles, this sequence of Lynette dodging Neuroi laser beams has her redrawn, presumably because her weapon was infront of the foreground beam.
28414|The rest of the time the shot is merely brighter. There is some extra motion blur here that wasn't there before.
28447|The motion blur is removed towards the end of the sequence.
28963|Lynette's face and chest have been redrawn;
28998|As she falls backwards, her pose is changed to spread her limbs out further.
29009|And finally, her strikers are foreshortened and the falling weapon is redrawn larger.
29340|Miyafuji <strike>copping a feel</strike> holding Lynette up have their bodies completely redrawn. The heads look the same to me, aside from Miyafuji's right ear being cut down and the eyes having more detail.
29668|Completely redrawn closeup shot here!
29719|Same with the long shot with better proportions on the striker and a tighter pose overall.
29760|Lighter sonic boom effect!
29825|<abbr title="Honestly, I've never really understood what these shots are trying to show, It makes out that they're tunnelling into the creature, but they always show the tunnel pre-formed, they're just spraying ammo everywhere to look cool, I guess.">Brighter tunnel shot of the interior of the Neuroi.</abbr> Check out the face of this tweenframed Miyafuji.

31050|The TV version of this shot zooms in slowly over a few seconds, while it's motionless elsewhere. Is the perspective of the runway a bit off, or is that just me? Makes the base look much smaller than it should be.
32236|There are lots of small changes in this tilt shot, such as Lynette's hair, a patch of Miyafuji's hair, Miyafuji's right hand, and a few shadows. I've stitched this shot together for easier viewing.
32369|The final fadeout before the credits is faster on TV.
