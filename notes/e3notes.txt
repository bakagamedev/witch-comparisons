04217 | This scroll to Nipa standing up waits a few frames before starting, and is much faster.

06300 | The shot is slightly zoomed out on the blu-ray version
06540 | Alongside the eyeshines, Rall's collar is shaded darker behind her neck.
06551 | Continuing the trend of removing bits of Nipa's face, the shadow below her mouth has been deleted.
06668 | Naoe is higher up and to the right in this shot, keeping the focus on her speaking rather than Hikari's busom.
06953 | Eyebeams. Also for a few frames of the TV version, a lock of Hikari's hair goes transparent below her eyelash.
07123 | A patch of her hair behind Hikari's neck has been fixed.
07485 | Her eyes have been shaded better, and there's a patch of blush on her cheek that is blended in with the shading.

12245 | Part of Rall's collar was mistakenly coloured the same as her shirt, this has been corrected.
12768 | For this sequence of Sadako cooking, she's been completely redrawn;
12769 | Hahahahahahahahahaha
13358 | Hikari has been redrawn slightly. Side note, since her blush marks and general skin tone is the same, I'm starting to suspect they use a digital texture or something to quickly fill in faces.
13708 | Hikari and Nipa have both been redrawn
13901 | The background to Nao doing some crossfit has been moved slightly.

15484 | Rossman's shirt colar has been fixed.

16116 | Nose!
16198 | CG touchup, completely different sky.

18243 | Alongside the eye shines, Hikari's hair shine is now missing a patch. Sasha's left iris has a different lower outline.

18807 | The highlight on Sasha's tights are more diffuse in these two shots.
18947 | 
19283 | The lighting is darker and even, and more importantly, Nao is now flying the correct striker unit! Probably a stock footage mixup, her striker looks similar to Chidori.

19954 | The lighting on Nipa and Nao's weapons is lighter, Sasha's face has been redrawn, and Hikari is floating lower and further away from the group.

20530 | The characters have been drawn in, awful CG facial animation is nowhere to be seen.
20720 | Clouds!
20805 | This tense action shot has had it's only muzzle flash removed. Weird. At least she's wearing her magic punch gloves.
20959 | Particles aren't as red or bloomy as they used to be, and the flash has been redrawn blurrier.
20972 | The shading on Nao's face is less sharp and jojo-y.
21048 | Hikari is holder her weapon lower, Nao is recoloured.
21146 | Clouds!
